I am currently in the process of migrating from Arch Linux to NixOS.
As a first step, I started using [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) on Arch Linux.
After that I started dual-booting Arch Linux and NixOS, so I can go back if I need something that is lacking from NixOS.

I currently use two machines: my desktop PC `volt` and my laptop `zephyr`.
Both of them are currently dual-booted, hence the somewhat messy configuration.
